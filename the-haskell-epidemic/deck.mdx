# The Haskell Epidemic

<img src='img/langs/haskell.png' style={{height: '45vh'}}/>

#### (Alt+P / Option+P for transcript)

<Notes>
  For those not familiar, Haskell is a general purpose, statically typed, functional programming language.
  Since I've started learning Haskell, I've come to notice that a lot of the
  great ideas in Haskell tend to spread out and infect other languages and ecosystems.
  <br/><br/>
  Some of them first appeared in Haskell and then took off, others appeared elsewhere and then Haskell helped popularise them.
</Notes>

## Data Types

<Notes>
  Let's talk about types.
  Like all languages, Haskell gives us a bunch of primitive data types out of the box:
  Int, Boolean, String, Char.
  <br/><br/>
  And at some point, you want to combine these small types into bigger ones.
</Notes>

---

```java Product Types

// C#
class Person {
  public string Name { get; }
  public int    Age  { get; }
  ...
}

// Scala
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
```

<Notes>
  One way of doing that is by pairing them together.
  For example, we might want to express that a `Person` is a pair of a string that represents their name
  and an integer that represents their age.
  <br/><br/>
  These are called product types, and most languages have something of the sort, C has structs, C# has classes (if you ignore the methods),
  other languages have records.
</Notes>

---

```haskell Product Types
data Person = Person String Int



data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }
----
1
*
```

<Notes>
  And here's what a product type looks like in Haskell.
  <br/><br/>
  We declare a data type called `Person`.
  That data type has a constructor also called `Person`, with two fields of type String and Int.
  <br/><br/>
  I can optionally also give these fields a name.
  <br/><br/>
  But this is only half the story.
  If classes and records let us say "a person is a string *and* an int",
  it makes sense that there should also be a way of saying "this new data type that I'm defining is either a string *or* an int".
</Notes>

---

```haskell Sum Types
data StringOrInt = ItsAString String | ItsAnInt Int

s = ItsAString "hello"

i = ItsAnInt 123
```

<Notes>
  And there is, they're called sum types!
  <br/><br/>
  For example, I can define a new data type called `StringOrInt`.
  And I create an instance of that type by using one of these two constructors.
  <br/><br/>
  ItsAString, and give it a string, or ItsAnInt and give it an int.
</Notes>


---

```haskell Sum Types
data LoginStatus = LoggedOut | LoggedIn Username Friends
```

<Notes>
  We can use sum types to model a lot of things.
  For example, a user's login status might be either logged out, in which case we know nothing about them,
  or they're logged in, in which case we know their username and who they're friends with.
</Notes>

---

```haskell
data Json = JNull
          | JBool Bool
          | JString String
          | JNumber Double
          | JArray [Json]
          | JObject (HashMap String Json)
```

<Notes>
  I can also use this to model arbitrary JSON documents.
</Notes>

---

```go
func trySomething() (*string, error) {
	if condition {
		hello := "hello"
		return &hello, nil
	} else {
		return nil, errors.New("Crashy McCrashface")
	}
}
```

<Notes>
  Here's a thing I really like about Go.
  In Go, you don't throw exceptions. The convention is: you return an error value, and then you just pass these around.
  <br/><br/>
  And that's a good thing because it forces us to think about error scenarios instead of just sweeping them under the rug,
  and also because it lets us look at the signature of a function and immediately know whether it can go wrong or not.
  <br/><br/>
  A function that can go wrong returns a tuple of a string and an error.
  If the function succeeds, you return a string and a null error.
  If it fails, you return a null string and an actual error.
</Notes>

---

```go
func trySomething() (*string, error) {
	if condition {
		hello := "hello"
		return &hello, errors.New("Crashy McCrashface")
	} else {
		return nil, nil
	}
}
----
4
4,6
```

<Notes>
  But there's nothing preventing me from returning *both* a string and an error,
  or even from returning neither.
</Notes>

---

```haskell
data Result = Success String | Failure Error

trySomething :: Result
trySomething =
  if condition
    then Success "hello"
    else Failure someError
```

<Notes>
  Instead of using a tuple, we could use a sum type to express precisely what we mean,
  and then we'll be able to return only a string in the case of success, or only an error in the case of failure.
</Notes>

</div>


<Notes>
  When you have a language that lets you freely combine products and sums, you say you have Algebraic Data Types.
  <br/><br/>
  And because products and sums complement each other, if they're both so fundamental, you'd think that every language should have these.
  I don't think it makes a lot of sense to have one but not the other.
  <br/><br/>
  But for a long time, most if not all mainstream languages only supported product types.
  Luckily that's changing.
  Lots of languages took a page from Haskell's book, and now you have Algebraic Data Types in Scala, Kotlin, Rust, Swift and TypeScript.
  <br/><br/>
  Java doesn't support this natively, but there is a library that you can sprinkle some annotations and it will generate all the boilerplate
  and make it seem like you do have ADTs in Java.

## Parser combinators

<Notes>
  Let's talk about parsing.
  Say there's a string you have to parse, and you know it follows some kind of pattern.
  And I ask you to parse that string and extract some piece of information from it.
  The first thing many people would think of is regular expressions.
  Anyone here a fan of regex?
</Notes>

---

<Image
  src='img/regex.png'
  size='100%'
/>

<Notes>
  Yeah, me neither.
  <br/><br/>
  So let's not talk about regular expressions, let's talk about an alternative, parser combinators.
</Notes>

export default Split

### parsec

* `string "hello"`
* `char 'a'`
* `anyChar`
* `letter`
* `digit`
* `space`
* ...

<Notes>
  In Haskell there's this really famous library called parsec.
  The parsec library gives us a ton of primitive parsers.
  We can use a parser that matches on the string "hello", or a parser that matches on the character 'a',
  or a parser that matches on any character at all *and* extracts it so I can use it later.
</Notes>

---

export default Split

### Combinators

* `<|>`, `choice`
* `>>`
* `do` notation
* `optional` / `option`
* `many`, `many1`
* `skipMany`
* `label`
* `sepBy`
* `between`
* `try`
* ...

<Notes>
  And it also gives us a ton of combinators that we can use to glue those little parsers together.
</Notes>


---

```haskell p1 <|> p2
parser = string "hello" <|> string "world"
```

<Notes>
  We may use the "or" combinator (that's not its name, but let's call it that), to say I want to match on "hello" or "world".
</Notes>

---

```haskell do notation
parser = do
  digit
  char ':'
  digit
```

<Notes>
  I can use haskell's do-notation to compose a sequence of parsers.
  <br/><br/>
  Here, I'm creating a new parser that will execute those 3 parsers in sequence.
  And it'll succeed if all 3 succeed, or it'll fail if any of those fail.
</Notes>

---

```haskell do notation
parser = do
  x <- digit
  _ <- char ':'
  y <- digit
  return (x, y)
```

<Notes>
  I can also use left arrows inside a do-block to say "when that sequence of parsers is run, and only if they're successful,
  I want to use the data they've captured, and in this case I'm just putting those two digits in a tuple".
</Notes>

---

```haskell
"[hello,world]"
```

<Notes>
  Let's see how these work in practice.
  Say I want to parse a string that begins and ends with a square bracket and contains a comma separated list of words.
</Notes>

---
```haskell
word = many1 letter

wordList = between
              (char '[')
              (char ']')
              (word `sepBy` char ',')


λ> parse wordList "" "[hello,world]"
Right ["hello","world"]
----
1
1,6
1:6
*
```

<Notes>
  I can start by defining a parser for a simple word, which is simply just the "letter" parser repeated 1 or many times.
  I want those words to be separated by the comma character,
  and I want all of that to be surrounded by square brackets.
  And that's it!
</Notes>
---

```haskell
data Json = JNull
          | JBool Bool
          | JString String
          | JNumber Double
          | JArray [Json]
          | JObject (HashMap String Json)
```

<Notes>
  What if we want something way more complex? What if we want to parse a raw json string into one of those json values
  that we defined earlier?
</Notes>

---

```haskell
jsonValue :: Parsec String () Json
jsonValue =
  choice [jstring, jnumber, jbool, jnull, jarray, jobject]
  where
    jnull = reserved "null" $> JNull
    jbool = reserved "true" $> JBool True <|> reserved "false" $> JBool False
    jstring = JString <$> stringLiteral
    jnumber = JNumber <$> lexeme (sign <*> floating2 True)
    jarray  = JArray  <$> brackets (commaSep jsonValue)
    jobject = JObject <$> HashMap.fromList <$> braces (commaSep keyValuePair)

    keyValuePair = do
      key   <- stringLiteral
      _     <- colon
      value <- jsonValue
      return (key, value)

    TokenParser {..} = makeTokenParser emptyDef

5[1:7]
5[1:7], 6[1:7, 15:19]
5[1:7], 6[1:7, 15:19], 7[1:3, 9]
5[1:7], 6[1:7, 15:19], 7[1:3, 9], 8[1:3, 12:16]
5[1:7], 6[1:7, 15:19], 7[1:3, 9], 8[1:3, 12:16], 9[1:3, 9:15]
5[1:7], 6[1:7, 15:19], 7[1:3, 9], 8[1:3, 12:16], 9[1:3, 9:15], 10[1:3, 13:19]
5[1:7], 6[1:7, 15:19], 7[1:3, 9], 8[1:3, 12:16], 9[1:3, 9:15], 10[1:3, 13:19], 11:16
2,3
*
```

<Notes>
  I can write a parser for that as well.
  Now, this slide is a bit heavy, but the basic idea is:
  if a piece of json can be one of six things, I'll just write six different parsers, one for each thing.
  <br/><br/>
  I'll look for the "null" reserved keyword.
  I can also look for the "true" keyword, or if that fails I'll try "false".
  I can look for a string literal, and that'll be my json string; or an optional sign and a floating point number.
  My JArray is just gonna be a comma separated list of json values surrounded by brackets.
  And my JObject is just gonna be a comma separated list of key-value pairs surrounded by braces.
  <br/><br/>
  And what's a key-value pair? Well, it's just a sequence of a string literal, a colon and a json value.
  And my overall parser is just a choice between any of those six things.
  <br/><br/>
  Note that I didn't have to worry about handling any whitespace, or escaped quotes inside string literals,
  or unicode characters.
  And there you go, a json parser that fits in one slide, written in 30 minutes or less.
  <br/><br/>
  The point I'm trying to make here is, I can use a bunch of little reusable parsers off the shelf, and combine them, like Lego bricks.
</Notes>

---

```haskell
λ> parse jsonValue  "" ""
Left (line 1, column 1):
unexpected end of input
expecting literal string, "-", "+", digit, "true", "false", "null", "[" or "{"
```

<Notes>
  On top of that, I get some pretty cool error messages for free.
  When I compose parsers together, their error messages also get automatically composed.

<Notes>
  Parser combinators are so easy to reuse and compose, that this `parsec` library
  has been ported to virtually every mainstream language.
  <br/><br/>
  So next time you need to parse something, like command line arguments, first check whether a
  parser combinator library exists for your language of choice.
</Notes>

## QuickCheck

---

```haskell
sort [3,2,1] == [1,2,3]
```

<Notes>
  Say I'm writing a sort function (as you do. for a whiteboard interview or something, because why else would you write a sort function?),
  <br/><br/>
  and I want to write some tests to make sure it works.
  I might start with a simple test like this.
  <br/><br/>
  But that doesn't guarantee that my sort function works at all!
  It could just be reversing the input list.
  So I'll write some more.
</Notes>

---

```haskell
sort [3,2,1] == [1,2,3]
sort [2,3,1] == [1,2,3]
sort []      == []
sort [1]     == [1]
sort [2,1,1] == [1,1,2]
----
1
1:2
1:3
1:4
*
```

<Notes>
  How confident are you that my sort function works with just these 5 tests?
  Should I keep going?
  How many unit tests are enough? Will they *ever* be enough?
  <br/><br/>
  The main problem here is that we're testing for specific inputs.
  What about inputs that we didn't think of?
  <br/><br/>
  So we need to take a step back and ask, what exactly are we testing here?
  What does it mean to sort a list?
</Notes>

---

## What's a sorted list?

* A permutation of the original list,
* where every element >= the next.

<Notes>
  Instead of testing for specific inputs, we'll test for these two properties.
</Notes>

---

```haskell Property Based Testing
prop_sortPermutation :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_sortPermutation list =
  sort list `isPermutationOf` list
  where
    isPermutationOf (head:tail) other =
        head `elem` other && isPermutationOf tail (delete head other)
    isPermutationOf [] [] = True
    isPermutationOf _ _   = False
----
*
3
```

<Notes>
  And QuickCheck lets us do exactly that.
  I can encode properties as plain old functions.
  So this is a function that takes a list, and we're saying: "for any list, any list at all, when I sort it, I should get a permutation of the original list".
</Notes>

---

```haskell Property Based Testing
prop_sortMonotonicity :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_sortMonotonicity list =
  isIncreasing (sort list)
  where
    isIncreasing (x : y : tail) = x <= y && isIncreasing (y:tail)
    isIncreasing _              = True
----
*
3
```

<Notes>
  And then we write another property that says that for any list, when sorted, the elements should be in increasing order.
</Notes>

---

```haskell Property Based Testing
quickCheck prop_sortPermutation
quickCheck prop_sortMonotonicity
```

<Notes>
  And then I just ask QuickCheck to verify that these two properties hold.
  And QuickCheck will feed these two functions random inputs and try its best to falsify these properties, it tries to find a counterexample.
  <br/><br/>
  If these two properties hold, we can be pretty sure our function is correct.
  And that's it, we've fully specified what it means to sort a list, no unit tests needed.
  <br/><br/>
  In practice though, you'll end up writing a mixture of both.
  What I personally do is try to encode as much as possible in types, and then write property based tests for the other things that are
  too expensive to encode with types, and then fill in the gaps using unit tests.
  <br/><br/>
  This method came to be known as "Property Based Testing", and it's great, I think, for two reasons.
  <br/><br/>
  First, because it's essentially generating tests for me, it catches lots of weird edge cases that I would never even dream of testing for.
  And second because it forces you to think about your program from a much higher perspective.
  It forces you to think about these properties, about the laws that govern your system.
</Notes>

---

```haskell Properties
parse :: String -> Maybe Json

render :: Json -> String
```

<Notes>
  One final example.
  If we go back to our json data type, you can imagine we'll also have a `render` function
  that sends that json value back to a raw string.
</Notes>

---

```haskell Properties
prop_parseRender :: Json -> Bool
prop_parseRender json =
  parse (render json) == Just json
```

<Notes>
  One thing we could test for is whether `parse` is the inverse function of `render`.
  If we have a json value and we render it to a string, and then parse it back again, we should get the json value that we had
  in the first place.
  <br/><br/>
  That's an incredibly useful property to have, because we want our encoders and decoders to be consistent.
</Notes>

---

## Does it scale?

### Yes!

<Notes>
  Does this scale? Yes.
  <br/><br/>
  You don't have to write property based tests at the unit level.
  You can use QuickCheck to validate your client's requirements.

## Do-notation

```haskell do-notation
do
  x <- digit
  _ <- char ':'
  y <- digit
  return (x, y)
```

<Notes>
  We've already seen Haskell's do-notation today, we used it to compose a sequence of parsers together.
</Notes>

---

## Do-notation

* Parsers
* Random data generators
* Async operations
* DB queries
* Collections
* Nullable values
* Validation
* Read from a shared state
* ...

<Notes>
  Turns out do-notation is much more universal than that!
  We can use it to combine a sequence of lots of other things, like random data generators, asynchronous operations
  like your Promises/Tasks/Futures, ...

<Notes>
  And some languages have already adopted this method of composition, like Scala, F# and C#.
  I think C# is my favourite out of these ones.

```java C#'s LINQ
from x in Digit()
from _ in Char(':')
from y in Digit()
select Tuple.Create(x, y)



from validName in ValidateName(name)
from validAge  in ValidateAge(age)
select new Person(validName, validAge)
```

<Notes>
  C#'s version of do-notation is my favorite because it's really well disguised.
  Most people when they learn C# and come across LINQ assume that it's a little language for combining collections, and that's it, that's all it's capable of.
  <br/><br/>
  When in fact, LINQ is so much more than that!
  <br/><br/>
  Everything I said you could do with Haskell's do-notation, you can also do with C#'s LINQ.

### Erik Meijer

![](img/erik.jpg)

<Notes>
  A little sidenote.
  The effort to add LINQ to C# was led by Erik Meijer, also known for his very colourful tshirts.
  He's really well known inside the C# community.
  But what you might not know is that he was also a member of the Haskell Committee.
  He managed to infiltrate the ranks and infect C#.

<Notes>
  This is something I've never seen before.
  Haskell's base library is so rich, so full of really generic abstractions, that these abstractions started getting ported to other languages.
  And these abstractions became like a standard toolkit for functional programming.
  <br/><br/>
  If you're doing FP in any of these languages, there's a good chance you're using one of these libraries.

  <br/>
  <img src="img/langs/dhall.png" style={{ height: '10vh' }}/>
</div>

<Notes>
  And the most compelling piece of evidence for Haskell's proliferation is all the languages that were born from it.
  <br/><br/>
  Nowadays you can use Eta to write Haskell on the JVM, and it has great interoperability with Java, so you can use lot of the existing stuff.
  They're also working on adding Android support at the moment, so I think the future is very bright there.
  <br/><br/>
  If you're into front-end, you can use Elm or PureScript.
  Elm is like a simpler version of Haskell, that compiles down to JavaScript.

<Notes>
  Elm is known for being an extremely safe language, and it's also very beginner friendly.
  <br/><br/>
  So if you're into font-end, Elm might be a good place to start.

<Notes>
  PureScript also compiles down to JavaScript, but it's capable of running on node.js, so you can write PureScript on the backend as well.
  <br/><br/>
  And finally Dhall, the latest addition to the family, it's a programmable configuration language,
  sorta like JSON but with functions + types + imports on top.

<Notes>
  My 2019 challenge to you is this:
  If Haskell is such a fertile ground for innovation and awesome ideas, why not just cut out the middle-man and get them straight from the source?
  Why wait? Why get them second-hand?
  I personally think there's never been a better time to learn Haskell than today.
  <br/><br/>
  So if you decide to do it, the Haskell Book is probably the best place to start.
  I don't recommend learning Haskell by piecing a bunch of blog posts together.
  So just get the book.
  <br/><br/>
  If you're a student or if for whatever reason you can't afford it, you can contact the authors and they'll work out a discount.
  <br/><br/>
  I've also heard really good things about Get Programming with Haskell.
  <br/><br/>
  There's an online course at typeclasses.com, they also do student discounts.
  <br/><br/>
  The easiest way to get started is to just download a tool called `Stack`.
  <br/><br/>
  If you have any questions at all, there's an FP Slack with an awesome community full of people from all over the world eager to give you a hand.
  There's also a local FP meetup here in Belfast.
  And if there's anything I can help you with, you can find me on twitter or just come talk to me after this.
  <br/><br/>
  That's all I have, thanks for listening!
