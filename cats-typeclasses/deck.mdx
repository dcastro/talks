# Cats Typeclasses

<!-- #### (Alt+P / Option+P for speaker notes) -->


---

## Cats typeclasses

* Functor
* Applicative functor
* Monad
* Traverse

---

```scala Imports
import cats._
import cats.implicits._

import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
```

---

```scala map
> List(1, 2, 3).map(x => x + 1)

< List(2, 3, 4)
```

<Notes>
  You've probably already used or seen someone using `map` to transform a list.
</Notes>

---

```scala map
Some(3).map(x => x + 1)

Future(user).map(u => u.userId)
```

<Notes>
  And you've probably already used map on other data types as well, like `Option` and `Future`
</Notes>

---

`map` is used to transform:

* `List[A]` - *each and every* element in the list
* `Either[E, A]` - the right value, *if it exists*
* `Validated[E, A]` - the value, *if it's valid*
* `Option[A]` - the optional value, *if it exists*
* `Future[A]` - the computed value, *if and when* it is computed
* `Gen[A]` - any value created by this generator

<Notes>
  It turns out there are lots of data types that define a `map` function.
  And in all those cases, `map` always means something slightly different.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def map[A, B](fa: List[A]  )(f: A => B): List[B]
def map[A, B](fa: Stream[A])(f: A => B): Stream[B]
def map[A, B](fa: Option[A])(f: A => B): Option[B]
def map[A, B](fa: Future[A])(f: A => B): Future[B]
def map[A, B](fa: Gen[A]   )(f: A => B): Gen[B]
```

<Notes>
  However, even though they do different things, they have 2 things in common.
  First, they never affect the structure itself, just its contents.
  If you're mapping over a list, and your list has 5 elements, the resulting list will also have 5 elements.
  If you're mapping over an Option, and that option is a Some, the result will also be a Some.
  If your future was successful, the result will also be successful.
  <br/><br/>
  Second, they kinda share the same type signature.
  <br/><br/>
  Which means we can generalise all these functions into a more generic one.
  All we have to do is replace the things that vary (List, Option, etc)...
</Notes>

---

```scala One map to rule them all!
def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
```

<Notes>
  ...  with a type variable.
</Notes>

---

```scala One map to rule them all!
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
}
```

<Notes>
  Which brings us to our first abstraction of the day.
  Functor is a typeclass that comes with the `cats` library, and generalises the concept of mapping over a type.
  <br/><br/>
  We say that a type `F` is a functor if it itself takes another type parameter, and you can map over it.
</Notes>

---

```scala One map to rule them all!
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
}

implicit val listFunctor:   Functor[List] = ???
implicit val optionFunctor: Functor[Option] = ???
implicit val genFunctor:    Functor[Gen] = ???
```

<Notes>
  And then we can create typeclass instances for all functors.
  <br/><br/>
  For example, we can say that List is a functor, by create an implicit instance of the trait, and
  specialising `F` to `List`.
  And then add an implemetation that says what it *means* to map over a list.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def unzip[A, B](list: List[(A, B)]): (List[A], List[B]) = {

  val justTheAs = fab.map { case (a, b) => a }
  val justTheBs = fab.map { case (a, b) => b }

  (justTheAs, justTheBs)
}



> unzip(List(("a", 1), ("b", 2)))

< (List(a, b),List(1, 2))
```

<Notes>
  Why is this useful?
  Why should you care about functors?
  <br/><br/>
  Because there are lots of functions that we define over and over and over again for lists, futures, options, etc,
  that we could instead just define once for all functors and be done with it.
  <br/><br/>
  Here's an example, a function called `unzip`, that separates a list of tuples, into a tuple of lists.
  If you look closely, you'll notice that all this function does is call `map` on the list.
  <br/><br/>
  That's all it needs, a map function, nothing more.
  Which means, that this function doesn't work just on lists, it works on anything that has a `map` function.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def unzip[A, B](list: List[(A, B)]): (List[A], List[B]) = 

def unzip[F[_] : Functor, A, B](fab: F[(A, B)]): (F[A], F[B]) =
----
1[10:17, 21:31], 3[4:10, 19:26, 30:40]
```

<Notes>
  So we can generalise `unzip`
  by replacing List with a type variable F, and adding a typeclass constraint to say that F
  could be any type, as long as it's a functor, as long as we can map over it.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def unzip[F[_] : Functor, A, B](fab: F[(A, B)]): (F[A], F[B]) = {

  val justTheAs = fab.map { case (a, b) => a }
  val justTheBs = fab.map { case (a, b) => b }

  (justTheAs, justTheBs)
}



> unzip(Option(("a", 1)))

< (Some(a),Some(1))
```

<Notes>
  Now I can call my `unzip` function on options, futures, generators.
  Instead of defining `unzip` lots and lots of times, I can define it just once and make it work with all functors ever.
</Notes>

---

## Applicative Functors

---

### Applicative

* A special kind of functor
* It lets you map over *many* `F[_]` simultaneuosly
* And you can embed a value `A` in a `F[A]`

---

```scala
> (Option(1), Option(2)).mapN(
    (x, y) => x + y
  )

< Option(3)
```

<Notes>
  For example,
  If I've got two options, I may want to combine them into a single option and merge their results.
</Notes>

---

```scala mapN
(Valid(username), Valid(userId)).mapN(
  (validUsername, validUserId) => User(validUsername, validUserId)
)

(Future(readFiles), Future(callService)).mapN(
  (fileRows, httpRows) => fileRows ++ httpRows
)
```

<Notes>
  Or if I'm validating a username and a user ID, i may want to then merge them into a valid user, if both the username and the user id pass validation.
  <br/><br/>
  Or if I've got two futures, I may want to collect their results into a single list.
  <br/><br/>
  All these data types are applicative functors.
  Again, just like functors generalise the concept of mapping over one thing,
  applicatives generalise the concept of merging and mapping over multiple independent things.
</Notes>

---

```scala
1.pure[Option]
1.pure[List]
1.pure[Future]
1.pure[Gen]
```

<Notes>
  The other thing you can do with applicative functors is embed a raw value like an Int in a context.
  <br/><br/>
  `1.pure[Option]` is going to wrap the value 1 in a `Some`.<br/><br/>
  `1.pure[List]` is going to wrap the value 1 in a list with the number 1 inside.<br/><br/>
  `1.pure[Future]` is going to wrap the value 1 in a future that always returns that number.<br/><br/>
  `1.pure[Gen]` is going to wrap the value 1 in a future that always generates the same number.
</Notes>

<!-- ---

```scala
trait Applicative[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
  def product[A, B](fa: F[A], fb: F[B]): F[(A, B)]

  def pure[A](a: A): F[A]
}
``` -->

---

```scala Recap
map:           F[A]             A => B     F[B]


mapN:      (F[A], F[B])      (A, B) => C   F[C]


pure:                             A        F[A]
```

---

## Monad

---

### Monad

* A special kind of applicative functor
* Lets you chain multiple `F[_]`
  * where one depends on the result of the other

<Notes>
  A monad is a special kind of applicative functor, meaning a monad does everything an applicative does,
  with one additional feature.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

def getFriends(userId: Int): Future[Friends] = ???



val getBob: Future[User] = getUser("bob")

val result: ? =
  getBob.map(user => getFriends(user.id))
----
1:3
1:3, 7
*
```

<Notes>
  For example, say we have a function that if you give it a username, it'll retrieves a User from the database.
  And then we have another function that given a user's id, it'll retrieve his friends.
  <br/><br/>
  So the first thing we do is call `getUser`, and that gives us a `Future[User]`.
  And then we want to use that user's ID, so we map over it and say "when that user comes back from the database,
  I want to pass his user ID to `getFriends`"
  <br/><br/>
  Anyone care to guess what the type of `result` is going to be?
</Notes>

---

### Following the types

<Notes>
  When you're faced complex types, this can be a bit daunting, so
  I'll show you a technique people usually call "following the types".
</Notes>

---

```plain
f(x, y) = x * y + x


f(2, 3) = 2 * 3 + 2 = 8
----
1
*
```

<Notes>
  If you have an expression like this and you're trying to make sense of it,
  you'll probably start by replacing the variables with concrete values.
</Notes>

---

```scala Following the types
map:           F[A]        A => B     F[B]
```

<Notes>
  Just like we can replace variables with concrete variables,
  we can replace type variables with concrete types.
  <br/><br/>
  So let's have another look at the signature of `map`.
  There's three type variables here: F, A and B.
  <br/><br/>
  Let's start with `F`.
  Since we're maping over futures, we know F = Future.
  So let's go ahead and replace F with Future.
</Notes>

---

```scala Following the types
map:       F[A]      A => B     F[B]

map:    Future[A]    A => B   Future[B]
```

<Notes>
  Right, that's progress.
  Next, A and B.
  Map takes a function from A to B.
</Notes>

---

```scala Following the types
user => getFriends(user.id)  :  User => Future[Friends]
----
1[0:7]
*
```

<Notes>
  This is the function we're passing to map.
  And this function takes a `User`, and returns a `Future` of their friends.
  Therefore, our `A` type variable is going to be `User`, and `B` is `Future[Friends]`.
</Notes>
---

```scala Following the types
map:         F[A]          A => B                         F[B]

map:      Future[A]        A => B                       Future[B]

map:    Future[User]   (User => Future[Friends])   Future[Future[Friends]]

```

<Notes>
  So now if we replace A with User, and B with Future[Friends], we can see that the final result
  is going to be Future[Future[Friends]].
  <br/><br/>
  This is just a little simple technique for grasping complex signatures with lots of type variables,
  just start substituting them until it makes sense.
  <br/><br/>
  It takes a bit of time to get a handle on this, there's a learning curve here, but in time it'll become
  natural to you, and you'll be able to do all of this in your head.
  And even though it seems like a massive pain in the butt right now, when you get used to, you can use all of this
  to your advantage.
  <br/><br/>
  Like any other tool, it takes time to learn how to wield it. It's a price you pay upfront, but you only pay it once.
  But once you do learn it, it's an incredibly useful tool to have in your toolbelt.
</Notes>

---

### Back to our regularly scheduled programming

---

```scala
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

def getFriends(userId: Int): Future[Friends] = ???



val getBob: Future[User] = getUser("bob")

val result: Future[Future[Friends]] =
  getBob.map(user => getFriends(user.id))
----
9[4:10], 10[1:2]
```

<Notes>
  So if we go back to our code, we now know that mapping over as future with another future, we get
  a nested future as a result.
  And if I had 3 futures I wanted to run, I'd end up with `Future[Future[Future[Friends]]]`
  <br/><br/>
  But this isn't really useful, right?
  We want to have a plain `Future[Friends]`.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

def getFriends(userId: Int): Future[Friends] = ???



val getBob: Future[User] = getUser("bob")

val result: Future[Friends] =
  getBob.map(user => getFriends(user.id)).flatten
----
9[4:7], 10[1:2, 13:14]
```

<Notes>
  This is where monads come in, because monads give us a `flatten` function, that flattens the nested future.
  This gives us a *new* future, that will run the other two futures sequentially.
</Notes>
---

```scala
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

def getFriends(userId: Int): Future[Friends] = ???



val getBob: Future[User] = getUser("bob")

val result: Future[Friends] =
  getBob.flatMap(user => getFriends(user.id))
----
9[4:7], 10[1:2]
```

<Notes>
  Or, instead of mapping and then flattening, we can do both things in one step with `flatMap`.
</Notes>

---

```scala
trait Monad[F[_]] extends Applicative[F[_]] {

  def flatMap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]

}
```

<Notes>
  And again, just like functors generalize `map`, and applicatives generalize `mapN`, monads generalize `flatMap`
</Notes>

---

```scala
map:          F[A]      A => B       F[B]

flatMap:      F[A]      A => F[B]    F[B]
```

<Notes>
  Let's have a look at flatMap's signature, because I know this can get a bit confusing.
  As you can see from the types, map and flatMap are very similar.
  <br/><br/>
  Map lets you replace the content of a structure, without affecting the structure itself.
  But `flatMap` lets you replace the content *AND* the wrapper with a new wrapper.
</Notes>

---

```scala Recap
map:           F[A]             A => B        F[B]


mapN:      (F[A], F[B])      (A, B) => C      F[C]


pure:                             A           F[A]


flatMap:       F[A]            A => F[B]      F[B]


flatten:                        F[F[A]]       F[A]
```

---

```scala For-comprehensions = flatMap+map
for {
  user    <- getUser("bob")
  friends <- getFriends(user.id)
} yield friends

getUser("bob")
  .flatMap(user => getFriends(user.id))
  .map(friends => friends)
```

<Notes>
  A little side-note,
  for-comprehensions in scala get compiled to flatMaps and maps.
  All those left-arrows get compiled to `flatMap`, and the `yield` at the end is a `map`.
  <br/><br/>
  So every time you wrote a for-comprehension, you were already using monads, you just didn't know it.
  <br/><br/>
  For-comprehensions in scala exist to make it a little easier to work with monads.
</Notes>

---

## Traverse

---

<!-- ```scala
case class User(pets: List[Pet])

val users: List[User] = ???

val pets: List[List[Pet]] = users.map(user => user.pets)

val pets: List[Pet] = users.map(user => user.pets).flatten
```

--- -->

```scala
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

val usernames: List[String] = ???

val users: List[Future[User]] =
  usernames.map(username => getUser(username))
```

<Notes>
  Say we now have a list of usernames, and for each and every one of them, we want to retrieve the corresponding user from the database.
  <br/><br/>
  We're mapping over that list, and for each username we're going to get a Future[User].
  Which means in the end, we'll have a list of futures.
  <br/><br/>
  But a list of futures is not very useful.
  If we want to return this to a client as JSON, we can't serialize a list of futures.
</Notes>

---

~~List[Future[User]]~~

Future[List[User]]

<Notes>
  What we want is to merge all these little futures together into one big future,
  that's going to wait for all the database calls to finish, and it's going to collect all the users into one big list.
  <br/><br/>
  So we *don't* want a list of futures, we want a future with a list.
  We esentially want to invert these two layers.
</Notes>

---

```scala sequence
def sequence(list: List[Future[User]]): Future[List[User]] =
  list match {
    case Nil          => Future(Nil)
    case head :: tail =>
      (head, sequence(tail))
        .mapN((first, rest) => first :: rest)
  }
```

<Notes>
  I could write a function myself to do this.
  Futures are applicatives, so I can go through the list and use mapN to join all those little futures together into one big future.
</Notes>

---

```scala sequence
sequence:      List[Future[A]]   ->   Future[List[A]]
```

<Notes>
  But I don't need to do that because cats already has a function that does this for me.
</Notes>

---

```scala sequence
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

val usernames: List[String] = ???

val users: Future[List[User]] =
  usernames.map(username => getUser(username)).sequence
----
5[4:10], 6[1:2, 11:12]
```

<Notes>
  So let's go ahead and put that into our code.
  <br/><br/>
  Now we've got one big future that will wait for all database calls to complete, and then put all the results into one list.
  <br/><br/>
  But, instead of mapping and then sequencing, we can do both things in one step with `traverse`.
</Notes>

---

```scala traverse
def getUser(username: String): Future[User] = ???

val usernames: List[String] = ???

val users: Future[List[User]] =
  usernames.traverse(username => getUser(username))
----
5[4:10], 6[1:2, 11:12]
```

<Notes>
  With traverse, we can now map over the list, run a bunch of futures, *and* collect all the results
</Notes>

---

```scala traverse
def traverse[A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => Future[B]): Future[List[B]]
```

<Notes>
  Now here's what the signature of `traverse` looks like.
  It takes a list of As, and a function from an A to a future of something else, and then returns one big future with a list.
</Notes>

---

```scala
usernameOpt.traverse(usernme => getUser(username))

userValidated.traverse(user => insertRow(user))
```

<Notes>
  Now, just like we can map over many data types, we can also traverse over lots and lots of things.
  <br/><br/>
  We can traverse over an option, and say: "if this option is not empty, retrieve the user from the database, and if it's empty don't do anything".
  <br/><br/>
  Or we can traverse over a possibly valid value, and say: "if this thing is valid, create a new entry in the database, otherwise do nothing".
  <br/><br/>
</Notes>

---

```scala traverse
def traverse[A, B](fa: List[A]        )(f: A => Future[B]): Future[List[B]]

def traverse[A, B](fa: Option[A]      )(f: A => Future[B]): Future[Option[B]]

def traverse[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A])(f: A => Future[B]): Future[Validated[E, B]]
```

<Notes>
  And if we put all these traverse signatures side by side, you'll probably notice a trend.
  <br/><br/>
  You can probably see where I'm going with this.
</Notes>

---

```scala Generalising traverse
def traverse[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => Future[B]): Future[F[B]]
```

<Notes>
  We can replace the things that vary with a type variable F.
</Notes>

---

```scala Generalising traverse
trait Traverse[F[_]] {

  def traverse[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => Future[B]): Future[F[B]]

}

object Traverse {
  implicit val listTraverse = ???
  implicit val optionTraverse = ???
  implicit val eitherTraverse = ???
  implicit val validatedTraverse = ???
}
----
1:5
*
```

<Notes>
  And in cats, this is captured by the `Traverse` typeclass, which describes all types F that can be traversed with a future.
</Notes>

---

```scala Generalising traverse
def traverse[A, B](fa: List[A]        )(f: A => Future[B]): Future[List[B]]

def traverse[A, B](fa: Option[A]      )(f: A => Future[B]): Future[Option[B]]

def traverse[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A])(f: A => Future[B]): Future[Validated[E, B]]
```

<Notes>
  But here's the thing: it's not just the type of the first argument that can vary, the second one can too!
  <br/><br/>
  That function there doesn't need to return a future!
</Notes>

---

```scala Generalising traverse
val validUsers: ValidatedNel[List[Username]] =
  users.traverse(user => validateUser(user))

val pets: Option[List[Pet]] =
  people.traverse(person => getOptionalPet(person))
----
1:2
*
```

<Notes>
  For exemple, here, I'm traversing over a list of users.
  But instead of returning a future, i'm now validating each user.
  So traverse will merge all these validations into a single big validation,
  which will be valid if all users are valid,
  or if any validation step fails, it's gonna aggregate all the errors.
  <br/><br/>
  Or instead of returning a validation, I can return an Option, and then traverse will merge all the options,
  and it'll be a Some if everything succeeds, or a None if any of those steps fail.
</Notes>

---

```scala Generalising traverse

def traverse[A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => Future[B]      ): Future[List[B]]

def traverse[A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => Option[B]      ): Option[List[B]]

def traverse[A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => Validated[E, B]): Validated[E, List[B]]
```

<Notes>
  You can see here the variation of that type.
</Notes>

---

```scala Generalising traverse
trait Traverse[F[_]] {

  def traverse[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => Future[B]): Future[F[B]]

  def traverse[G[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => G[B]): G[F[B]]

  def traverse[G[_] : Applicative, A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => G[B]): G[F[B]]

}
----
1, 9, 3
1, 9, 3[21:24, 27:33], 5[4:7, 26:29, 32:38]
1, 9, 7[4:10]
1, 9, 7
```

<Notes>
  This means that we can also replace Future there, with a type variable `G` instead.
  <br/><br/>
  We do have to add a constraint here.
  Internally, traverse combines all those little futures, or all those little validations into a final big validation,
  by calling `mapN` to merge everything together.
  <br/><br/>
  So we do have to add a constraint here, to say that G can be anything, as long we can call `mapN` on it.
  <br/><br/>
  And then we have a fully generalised `traverse` that works on an infinite number of things.
</Notes>

flatMap:       F[A]            A => F[B]      F[B]

flatten:                        F[F[A]]       F[A]

traverse:      F[A]            A => G[B]     G[F[B]]

sequence:                       F[G[A]]      G[F[A]]
```

<Notes>
  You can use this as a reference table.
  So whenever you have something and you want to transform it into something else but
  you don't quite know how, there's a good chance you might need one of these "glue" functions.

<Notes>
  I also put together a table to quickly see whether you can map, flatMap or traverse over
  something.
  <br/><br/>
  Also, just to drive home the point of how important these abstractions are:
  notice how we have 4 traversable things here, and 6 that can be merged using mapN.
  <br/><br/>
  This means that there's 24 ways to traverse a structure!
  If we didn't have the Traverse typeclass, we'd have to define 24 different traverse functions!
  Think about it: traverse list with list, traverse list with option, list with future, etc.
  And that's just considering this handful of types, but there are many many more, so technically, there could be an infinite number
  of different traverse functions.
  <br/><br/>
  But with the traverse typeclass, we have one function, implemented 4 times.

## 👨‍⚖️ Laws ⚖️

<Notes>
  One thing I've refrained from mentioning so far is that these typeclasses have laws.
</Notes>

---

```scala Functor Laws
  fa.map(a => a)   ===   fa

fa.map(f).map(g)   ===   fa.map(a => g(f(a)))
```

<Notes>
  The first law says that mapping over, say, a list with a function that just returns its argument, should be the same as not doing anything.
  The list should remain unchanged.
  <br/><br/>
  This basically guarantees what I said at the beginning, that map is not allowed to change the structure,
  it's not allowed to shuffle the elements in a list while mapping over it, or it's not allowed to turn a Some into a None,
  otherwise it would break this law.
  <br/><br/>
  The second laws says that mapping over a list with a function, and then mapping over it again with another function,
  should be the same as mapping over it once, with both functions at the same time.
  <br/><br/>
  This law guarantees that it's always safe to fuse multiple maps.
  So whenever you see a call to map like that, you can rewrite it, which will *probably* be more efficient.
</Notes>

```scala Functor Laws
// https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/lawtesting.html

import cats.laws.discipline.FunctorTests
import cats.tests.CatsSuite	

class TreeLawTests extends CatsSuite {
  checkAll("Tree.FunctorLaws",
    FunctorTests[Tree].functor[Int, Int, String])
}
```

<Notes>
  Luckily, you don't have to worry too much about these laws, you don't need to memorize them,
  because cats comes with suits to automatically test them.
  So you could easily write a couple of lines of code to check whether your tree functor obeys these two laws.
</Notes>

### Why should I care?

---

```java Functors are everywhere!
// C#
list.Select(x => x + 1)

// Java
list.stream()
    .map(x -> x + 1)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Javascript
list.map(x => x + 1)
```

<Notes>
  You've been using functors, applicatives and monads every day, even before you wrote scala.
</Notes>

---

```java Monads are everywhere!
// Javascript
promise.andThen(x => anotherPromise(x))

// Javascript / C#
var x = await promise();
anotherPromise(x)
```

<Notes>
  Or if you've used promises in javascript, you were using monads too!
  <br/><br/>
  All these abstractions we talked about they exist, independently of scala,
  just like addition exists independently of the + operator in scala, or whatever language.
  <br/><br/>
  The difference is, in Scala with cats, we recognize these abstractions and give them a name.
  And by giving them a name, we can talk about them, talk about things that can be mapped over, talk about things that can be traversed, or merged together.
  Also, in time you learn to recognise these patterns in your own code.
  <br/><br/>
  Someday you'll be writing a piece of code and realise that your data type is also a functor.
  So everything that works on functors, will automatically work on your new data type as well.
