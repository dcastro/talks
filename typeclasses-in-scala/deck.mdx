# Typeclasses in Scala

<!-- #### (Alt+P / Option+P for speaker notes) -->

```scala
def postRequest(content: ?) = {
  val request = Request(content.toJson)
  post(request)
}
```

<Notes>
  Say I want to write a function that takes a variable of any type that's convertible to Json.
  I don't know what the type of that argument is going to be yet, but I want to be something that I can convert to JSON.
  That could be strings, ints, your domain objects like `Person`, or a list of `Person`.
  <br/><br/>
  We want to be able to abstract over all these types, we want to be able to say "all these types are encodable, everything else isn't".
</Notes>

---

```scala
trait Encodable {
  def toJson: Json
}

case class Person(name: String, age: Int) extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.obj(
      "name" := this.name,
      "age"  := this.age
    )
}

case class Dog(name: String) extends Encodable {
  ...
}

```

<Notes>
  Usually, in Java or C#, you'd solve this using an interface.
  You define an interface for things that can be encoded, and then write classes that implement that interface.
  You write a `toJson` method that converts the `this` object to Json.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def postRequest(content: Encodable) = {
  val request = Request(content.toJson)
  post(request)
}
```

<Notes>
  And now we're able to complete the type signature for our function.
  The argument `content` is of any type that implements the Encodable interface.
</Notes>

---

```scala
class String extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.fromString(this)
}
```

<Notes>
Let's try making other types encodable.
String, for example, should be encodable.
So we just add the `Encodable` interface to the `String` type.
</Notes>

---

```scala
//            |  nope
//            v
class String extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.fromString(this)
}
```

<Notes>
But we can't do this! The String type is in the standard lib, we can't just change it and make it implement our interface!
</Notes>

---

```scala
class ListWrapper[A](list: List[A]) extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.arr(
      list.map(elem => elem.toJson)
    )
}
----

```

<Notes>
  Let's try lists now.
  We know we can't change Scala's list type, so let's declare our own list wrapper, that wraps around a standard list, and is encodable.
  To encode a list of things, we just encode every single thing, and wrap them all up in a Json array, easy.
</Notes>

---
```scala
//                |  A needs to be encodable
//                v
class ListWrapper[A](list: List[A]) extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.arr(
      list.map(elem => elem.toJson)
      //                   ^
      //                   | Can't call `toJson`
    )
}
```

<Notes>
But we can't do this either.
We can't call `toJson` on the elements of the list because we don't know whether they're encodable.
<br/><br/>
If we have a list of ints, sure, that's easy to encode.
But if we have a list of functions, or a list of DB connections, we can't serialize that to JSON.
</Notes>

---

### We want to say

`List[A]` is encodable if and only if `A` is encodable.

---

### Limitations of interfaces

* Can't make other people's types implement our interfaces
* Can't implement interfaces conditionally

---

## Enter typeclasses

---

```scala
// the typeclass
trait Encodable[A] {
  def toJson(a: A): Json
}

// the data type
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)

object Person {

  // the typeclass instance
  implicit val encodeInstance: Encodable[Person] =
    new Encodable[Person] {
      def toJson(person: Person): Json = ???
    }
}

----

```

<Notes>
  First we define the typeclass.
  It's still a trait, but we're gonna use it differently.
  All typeclasses have at least one type parameter, in this case the type parameter `A`, and that's the type we're describing.
  We're saying `A` is encodable if there's a `toJson` function that takes a value of type `A` and returns a `Json`.
  <br/><br/>
  Next we define our type, just like we usually do.
  Notice how we don't need to extend anything.
  The typeclass knows nothing about the type, and the type knows nothing about the typeclass.
  They're completely separated.
  <br/><br/>
  And finally we create a typeclass *instance* that marries the two together.
  We instantiate the trait, replacing `A` with `Person`.
  We're creating a proof that values of type `Person` can be encoded.
  <br/><br/>
  And we have to mark it as implicit.
  <br/><br/>
  This is how you define a typeclass, but how do you use it?
</Notes>
---

```scala
def postRequest[A](content: A)(implicit instance: Encodable[A]) = {
  val request = Request(instance.toJson(content))
  post(request)
}
----
*
1[2:9]
1[2:18]
1[2:18], 2[6:11]
```

<Notes>
  If we go back to our `postRequest` function and update it.
  Now our `postRequest` method is capable of taking a value of any type `A`, as long as there's an 
  `Encodable` instance for it defined somewhere.
  So this `implicit` here works as a constraint.
  We're saying, you can call this method with a value of any type as long as that type is encodable.
  <br/><br/>
  If that type is *not* encodable, that you can't call this method.
  <br/><br/>
  And then we can use the instance to convert the content to json.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def postRequest[A](content: A)(implicit instance: Encodable[A]) = {
  val request = Request(instance.toJson(content))
  post(request)
}

postRequest(Person("bob", 30))

postRequest(Person("bob", 30))(Person.encodeInstance)
//                                ^
//                                |
//     The compiler will automatically insert the instance here
----
1:6
*
```

<Notes>
  So if we try to call this method with a `Person`, the compiler will look for an implicit encoder for person.
  If it can find one, it automatically inserts it there, and the code compiles and everything works fine.
  <br/><br/>
  Cool, but let's see if this solves the problems we had earlier.
</Notes>

---
```scala
def postRequest[A](content: A)(implicit instance: Encodable[A]) = {
  val request = Request(instance.toJson(content))
  post(request)
}

postRequest(Desk("wood"))
//             ^
//             |
//     Doesn't compile.
//     There is no `Encoder[Desk]`
----
*
```

---

```scala
implicit val encodeString: Encodable[String] =
  new Encodable[String] {
    def toJson(s: String): Json = ???
  }

postRequest("hello")
----
1:4
*
```

<Notes>
  So previously, we couldn't say thats strings are encodable, because we couldn't make it implement our interface.
  But with typeclasses, all we have to do is create a new instance that says that strings are encodable, and that's it!
</Notes>

---


```scala List[A] is encodable if A is encodable.
implicit def encodeList[A]: Encodable[List[A]] =
  new Encodable[A] {
    def toJson(list: List[A]): Json = ???
  }
```

<Notes>
  The other problem we had was: we wanted to express that lists are encodable if their elements are encodable.
  Let's start by defining a standard Encodable instance for lists.
</Notes>

---

```scala List[A] is encodable if A is encodable.
implicit def encodeList[A](implicit encodeElement: Encodable[A]): Encodable[List[A]] =
  new Encodable[A] {
    def toJson(list: List[A]): Json = ???
  }
----
*
1[17:23]
1[7:23]
```

<Notes>
  Now, we can add another implicit to express our constraint.
  So now we're saying: "I'll give you an encoder for a list of `A`s, if you give me an encoder for a single `A`".
  <br/><br/>
  Again, we're using implicits to express constraints, or conditions.
</Notes>

---

```scala List[A] is encodable if A is encodable.
implicit def encodeList[A](implicit encodeElem: Encodable[A]): Encodable[List[A]] =
  new Encodable[A] {
    def toJson(list: List[A]): Json =
      Json.arr(
        list.map(elem => encodeElem.toJson(elem))
      )
  }

postRequest(List(bob, tom))    // compiles

postRequest(List(doggo))       // doesn't compile
----
1:7
*
```

<Notes>
  And now we can complete the definition by converting every element, wrapping everything in a json array, and everything will compile.
</Notes>

## Typeclasses in the wild

---

```scala
trait Numeric[A] {
  def plus(x: A, y: A): A
  def times(x, A, y: A): A
  ...

  def zero: A
}
```

<Notes>
  Just as an example, in scala's standard library, there's a typeclass that describes numeric types.
  A type is numeric if you can add two values of type A and return a third value of type A.
</Notes>

---

```scala
implicit val numericLong: Numeric[Long] =
  new Numeric[Long] {
    def plus(x: Long, y: Long): Long = x + y
    def times(x: Long, y: Long): Long = x * y
    ...

    def zero: 0L
  }

implicit val numericInt: Numeric[Int] =
  new Numeric[Int] {
    def plus(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
    def times(x: Int, y: Int): Long = x * y
    ...

    def zero: 0
  }
```

<Notes>
  And then there's typeclass instances for Long, Int, etc.
</Notes>

---

```scala

def sum[A](list: List[A])(implicit numericA: Numeric[A]): A =
  ???

sum(List(1, 2, 3))          // 6

sum(List(1L, 2L, 3L))       // 6L

sum(List(1.0d, 2.0d, 3.0d)) // 6.0d

sum(List(bob, tom))         // doesn't compile
```

<Notes>
  And with this typeclass, we're able to abstract over all numeric types.
  For example, we can define a `sum` function that calculates the total sum of a list of any numeric type.
</Notes>

### Moar typeclasses!

* Standard lib
  * `Numeric[A]`
  * `Integral[A]` / `Fractional[A]`
  * `Ordering[A]`
* Circe
  * `Encoder[A]`
  * `Decoder[A]`
* Akka: `FromEntityUnmarshaller[A]`
* Diff: `Entity[A, K]`

---

### Moar typeclasses!

* Cats
  * `Eq[A]`
  * `Show[A]`
  * `Functor[A]`
  * `Applicative[A]`
  * `Monad[A]`
  * `Traverse[A]`

---

### What if I want to have more than 1 instance?

* Don't use typeclasses

---


### Typeclasses

* Introduced in Haskell
* Rust
* Kotlin (soon)
* Scalar 3 (?)

<!-- 
TODO:
context bounds
define it in the companion object of either type




exercise: maybe not at the end, before explaining context bounds
define an Orderable typeclass, instances for Int, long
define a function `maximum` that takes a List[A] and returns an Option[A] with the max value or None
curveball: define an `Orderable[Option[A]]` only if `A` itself is oderable.


say: if someone wants to do a session on something they've recently learned, you're more than welcome to
ask: or, the other way around, if there's something about Scala you want to know more about, something that
     you find confusing for example, just say the word and we'll get something organized
