# Typeclasses in Scala

<!-- #### (Alt+P / Option+P for transcript) -->

```scala
def postAsJson(content: ?) = {
  val request = Request(content.toJson)
  post(request)
}
```

<Notes>
  Say I want to write a function that takes a variable of any type that's convertible to Json.
  I don't know what the type of that argument is going to be yet, but I want to be something that I can convert to JSON.
  That could be strings, ints, your domain objects like `Person`, or a list of `Person`.
  <br/><br/>
  We want to be able to abstract over all these types, we want to be able to say "all these types are encodable, everything else isn't".
</Notes>

```scala
trait Encodable {
  def toJson: Json
}

case class Person(name: String, age: Int) extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.obj(
      "name" := this.name,
      "age"  := this.age
    )
}

case class Person(name: String) extends Encodable {
  ...
}

<Notes>
  Usually, in Java or C#, you'd solve this using an interface.
  You define an interface for things that can be encoded, and then write classes that implement that interface.
  You write a `toJson` method that converts the `this` object to Json.
</Notes>

---

```scala
def postAsJson(content: Encodable) = {
  val request = Request(content.toJson)
  post(request)
}
```

<Notes>
  And now we're able to complete the type signature for our function.
  The argument `content` is of any type that implements the Encodable interface.
</Notes>

---

```scala
class String extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    ???
}
```

<Notes>
Let's try making other types encodable.
String, for example, should be encodable.
So we just add the `Encodable` interface to the `String` type.
</Notes>

---

```scala
//            |  nope
//            v
class String extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.fromString(this)
}
```

<Notes>
But we can't do this! The String type is in the standard lib, we can't just change it and make it implement our interface!
</Notes>

---

```scala
class ListAdapter[A](list: List[A]) extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    Json.arr(
      list.map(elem => elem.toJson)
    )
}
```

<Notes>
  Let's try lists now.
  We know we can't change Scala's list type, so let's declare our own list and make that encodable.
  To encode a list of things, we just encode every single thing, and wrap them all up in a Json array, easy.
</Notes>

---
```scala
//                |  A needs to be encodable
//                v
class ListAdapter[A](list: List[A]) extends Encodable {

  def toJson: Json =
    ???
}
```

<Notes>
We can't do this either.

### Limitations of interfaces

* Can't make other people's types implement our interfaces
* Can't implement interfaces conditionally

---

### What if I want to have more than 1 instance?

* Don't use typeclasses

---

### Typeclasses

* Introduced in Haskell
* Rust
* Kotlin (soon)
* Scalar 3 (?)
